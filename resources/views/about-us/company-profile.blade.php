          <p class="mb-4">
              Established in 1992 as Suraksha Diagnostics Private Ltd. in Kolkata, we started as one of the first diagnostic centers in Kolkata to provide all pathology and radiology services under one roof. This convenience, along with our unwavering commitment to accuracy and service, resulted in steady growth and popularity. Within 3 years we could confidently open a second Center at Siliguri, in North Bengal, which remains the largest such facility in the region, and today serves not only to patients from North Bengal, but also neighboring States and countries. Since then, we have grown steadily across West Bengal, Bihar and Assam.
